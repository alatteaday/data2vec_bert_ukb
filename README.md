# Training a BERT Model using the Data2Vec Method with the UKBioBank Dataset

This project demonstrates how to train a BERT model using the Data2Vec method. 
The UKBioBank dataset, a comprehensive biomedical dataset, is used for this implementation. 
The primary goal is to illustrate the process and provide a template for similar tasks.

## Data2Vec Method

Data2Vec is a versatile self-supervised learning framework that works across multiple data modalities such as text, speech, and vision. 
It employs a Transformer architecture to predict latent representations of the full input data from a masked version of the input, using a self-distillation approach. 
This method aims to create continuous and contextualized embeddings, enabling the model to learn representations that are not limited by a predefined vocabulary size 
and can capture the context surrounding the data points​​.

## Dataset

The UKBioBank dataset is utilized in this project. 
It is a large-scale biomedical database containing detailed genetic and health information from half a million UK participants. 
Only a portion of this dataset is provided for this implementation to demonstrate the training process​.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/alatteaday/data2vec_bert_ukb.git
cd data2vec_bert_ukb/
```

2. Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Environment Setting:
Ensure all dependencies are installed by running the above installation command.

2. Configuration:
